title: GSoC 2014 with GNOME Maps !!
---

I have been selected for [GSoC](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/projects/list/google/gsoc2014) this year with [GNOME](https://gnome.org "GNOME").
My submitted Proposal is [here](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/rocker_raj/5657382461898752) and a very brief description for GNOME is [here](https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreach/SummerOfCode/2014/Projects/RishiRajSinghJhelumi_MapsPointsOfInterests).   

I will be working this summer on [GNOME Maps](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Mapsâ€Ž "GNOME Maps").
My project will aim at displaying relevant Points of Interest (POI) near an area at the innermost zoom levels according to these [mockups](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/edit/Design/Apps/Maps).

I will be mentored by [Mattias Bengtsson](https://plus.google.com/+MattiasBengtsson) and co-mentored by [Jonas Danielsson](https://plus.google.com/103582536569221580484).
Mattias was the one to start the GNOME Maps application and was also a GSoC'13 student who worked on Routing for Maps and Jonas is currently the co-maintainer for the Maps.

I will be publishing my changes at [Code Repo](https://github.com/rishirajsinghjhelumi/GNOME-Maps) and specifically the [POI Branch](https://github.com/rishirajsinghjhelumi/GNOME-Maps/tree/wip/poi).

I will also be working with two other students [Dario Di Nucci](https://plus.google.com/+DarioDiNucci) and [Damian Nohales](https://plus.google.com/+Dami%C3%A1nNohales) who have also been selected for GSoC this year to work on GNOME Maps.
Dario will be working on [Adding Routing support for via points](https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreach/SummerOfCode/2014/Projects/DarioDiNucci_MapsViaPoints) and Damian on [Foursquare and Facebook Check-In integration](https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreach/SummerOfCode/2014/Projects/DamianNohales_MapsFoursquareFacebook).

I am really excited to be a part of the GNOME community.
